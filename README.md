# SOLID Principles
SOLID principles problems review with samples and solutions.

## Covered Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Concepts
### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only a single responsibility.
### Open/Closed Principle
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
### Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
### Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
### Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
